    <h1>Drug Scheduling </h1>
    <h2> By Carmen Reinicke </h2>

<p> The <a href="https://www.dea.gov/index.shtml" target="_blank"> Drug Enforcement Administration </a> classifies drugs, substances, and chemicals used to make drugs into five categories called schedules as outlined by the Controlled Substance Act. <p>

 <p> "It's a good, safe effort," said Jonathan Caulkins, a drug policy researcher and professor at Carnegie Mellon. "It is lampooned by people who want to make policies foolish and there's an intentional misunderstanding of schedule 1." <p> 

<h3> Drug Schedules</h3>
<p id="chart"> Click through the chart to see the definiton of each schedule from the <a href="https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml" target="_blank"> DEA.</a> <p>

<div id="schedule_1" class="slider">
  <a href="#">Schedule 1</a>
  <div class="panel">
    Drugs with NO currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.
  </div>
</div>

<div id="schedule_2" class="slider">
  <a href="#">Schedule 2</a>
  <div id="p2" class="panel">
    Drugs with a high potential for abuse. Can lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.
  </div>
</div>

<div id="schedule_3" class="slider">
  <a href="#">Schedule 3</a>
  <div id= "p3" class="panel">
    Drugs with moderate to low potential for abuse, physical and psychological dependence.
  </div>
</div>

<div id="schedule_4" class="slider">
  <a href="#">Schedule 4</a>
  <div id = "p4" class="panel">
    Drugs with low potential for abuse or dependence.
  </div>
</div>

<div id="schedule_5" class="slider">
  <a href="#">Schedule 5</a>
  <div id="p5" class="panel">
    Drugs with lower potential for abuse than schedule 4.
  </div>
</div>

<!-- <div id="flip2"> Schedule 2</div>
<div id="panel2"> Drugs with a high potential for abuse. Can lead to severe psychological or physical dependence</div>
<div id="flip3"> Schedule 3</div>
<div id="panel3"> Drugs with moderate to low potential for abuse, physical and psychological dependence.</div>
<div id="flip4"> Schedule 4</div>
<div id="panel4"> Drugs with low potential for abuse or dependence.</div>
<div id="flip5"> Schedule 5</div>
<div id="panel5"> Drugs with lower potential for abuse than schedule 4.</div> -->

  <p> "The international treaties recognize no benefit of a psychoactive drug other than medicine," Caulkins continued, "So if there's a drug out there that provides fun, joy, with mild addictive liability, it is banned." <p>

<p>This argument is most easily applied to marijuana, which provides fun and relaxation with a low potential for addiction. The substance, however, is ranked schedule 1, along with heroin and cocaine.  
 <p>

  <p> It is also important to note that the drug schedule does not necessarily correlate with criminality. While the schedule 1 drugs are all illegal, drugs from other schedules can be abused illegally. <p>
