    <h1>Drug Scheduling </h1>
    <h2> By Carmen Reinicke </h2>

    <p> The <a href https://www.dea.gov/index.shtml target="blank"> Drug Enforcement Administration </a> classifies drugs, substances, and chemicals used to make drugs into five categories called schedules as outlined by the Controlled Substance Act.
      <p>

        <p> "It's a good, safe effort," said Jonathan Caulkins, a drug policy researcher and professor at Carnegie Mellon. "It is lampooned by people who want to make policies foolish and there's an intentional misunderstanding of schedule 1."

                <div id="schedule_1" class="slider">
                  <a href="#">Schedule 1</a>
                  <div class="panel">
                    Drugs with NO currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse
                  </div>
                </div>

                <div id="schedule_2" class="slider">
                  <a href="#">Schedule 2</a>
                  <div class="panel">
                    Drugs with a high potential for abuse. Can lead to severe psychological or physical dependence
                  </div>
                </div>

                <div id="schedule_3" class="slider">
                  <a href="#">Schedule 3</a>
                  <div class="panel">
                    Drugs with moderate to low potential for abuse, physical and psychological dependence.
                  </div>
                </div>

                <div id="schedule_4" class="slider">
                  <a href="#">Schedule 4</a>
                  <div class="panel">
                    Drugs with low potential for abuse or dependence.
                  </div>
                </div>

                <div id="schedule_5" class="slider">
                  <a href="#">Schedule 5</a>
                  <div class="panel">
                    Drugs with lower potential for abuse than schedule 4.
                  </div>
                </div>
                <p> "The international treaties recognize no benefit of a psychoactive drug other than medicine," Caulkins continued, "So if there's a drug out there that provides fun, joy, with mild addictive liability, it is banned."
                  <p>

                    <p>This argument is most easily applied to marijuana, which provides fun and relaxation with a low potential for addiction. The substance, however, is ranked schedule 1, along with heroin and cocaine.
